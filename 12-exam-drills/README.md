# Exam Drills (Timed)

Unzip at repo root to create `12-exam-drills/`.

Rules:
- Run with a timer. Diagnose, fix, verify.
- Prefer fixes that avoid replacement.
- End-state: `terraform plan` is clean OR shows only intended change.
- When you use `force-unlock`, be sure the lock is truly stale.

Prereq:
- LocalStack running: `docker compose up -d`
