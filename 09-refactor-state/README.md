## What this lab teaches you
This lab demonstrates how to **change code without changing infrastructure**.

Concepts covered:
- `moved` blocks

- Safe refactors

## Key takeaway
Resource addresses define identity, not resource names.

## Exam notes
Refactor/state questions separate beginners from experienced users.
