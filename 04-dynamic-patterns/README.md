# Lab 04 — Dynamic Blocks and Optional Configuration

## What this lab teaches you
This lab shows how to create **optional nested blocks** using `dynamic`.

Concepts covered:
- `dynamic` blocks
- Conditional inclusion
- Complex object variables

## Why this matters
Many real Terraform resources have optional nested blocks.
Dynamic blocks let you avoid duplication while keeping flexibility.

## Exercises
1. Enable/disable a dynamic block via variables
2. Add multiple nested blocks via a list

## Exam notes
Understand when `dynamic` is required vs simple conditionals.
