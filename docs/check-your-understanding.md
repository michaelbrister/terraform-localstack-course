# Check Your Understanding (All Labs)

Use these questions after each lab.

## Core Questions
1. What resource(s) does this lab create?
2. Where is Terraform state stored?
3. What would happen if state was deleted?
4. Would Terraform recreate or update resources? Why?

## Plan Reading
- What is being added?
- What is being changed?
- Why does Terraform think this is necessary?

## Red Flags
- Unexpected replacement
- Count index changes
- Backend misconfiguration

If you can answer these without guessing, you understand the lab.
