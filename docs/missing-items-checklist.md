# Additional high-ROI items to consider

## Associate extras
- A short lab covering `terraform workspace` commands (conceptual + caution)
- `-replace` / taint concepts and safe usage
- A doc covering state subcommands: list/show/mv/rm/pull

## Professional extras
- Module versioning + promotion (tag releases; pin refs in live/*; changelog)
- Expanded policies (require Name tag; prevent overly-broad IAM policies)
- Drift monitoring pattern (scheduled plan/report)

## CI extras
- Add `tflint` and `tfsec` (or `trivy config`) as additional gates
