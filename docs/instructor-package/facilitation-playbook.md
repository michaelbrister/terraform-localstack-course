# Facilitation Playbook

## Session template (60–90 minutes)
1) 10 min: concept briefing
2) 30–45 min: hands-on lab
3) 10 min: plan review discussion (what changed and why)
4) 10 min: “predict the plan” mini-quiz
5) 5 min: recap + homework

## How to handle different learner levels
- Non-programmers: slow down and use analogies (state = memory)
- Experienced: add optional challenges (refactor, import, policy)

## Intervention patterns
- If learner applies without reading plan: stop and review plan output together
- If learner uses count incorrectly: teach stable keys and identity
- If learner panics about state: remind them localstack is a sandbox

## Instructor demo suggestions
- Show a plan with replacement and explain why
- Show how moved blocks avoid replacement
- Show how policy gates catch drift before apply
